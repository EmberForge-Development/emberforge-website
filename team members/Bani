Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bani, a 17-year-old from Croatia with a lifelong passion for computers and game development. Ever since I was young, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how things work behind the scenes, which led me to Minecraft modding, plugin development, and managing projects.

At EmberForge, I take on multiple roles: Organization Manager, Developer, Tester, and Support Team. In the past Iâ€™ve worked on a zombie apocalypse modpack, a combat log plugin, and various private projects, always striving to push the limits of whatâ€™s possible. Before joining EmberForge, I mostly worked alone, but now Iâ€™m excited to be part of a team that shares my passion.

My goal is to create mods and modpacks that people love, grow my projects into something well-known, and maybe even turn my passion into a career. Whether it's coding, testing, managing, or problem-solving, I'm always looking to improve and take things to the next level!
