Hi, I'm Kobalt! I'm 27 years old and I love to create new things! I've been making Minecraft Mods for 6 years, but I haven't really made anything worthwhile until 2024 when I met my friend WereF0X in Kinetic Hosting where I took on the task of assisting him with the No Dimensions(now DimensionZ) mod which has undergone many changes. I tried managing my own team to create mods, but unfortunately I wasn't cut out for the position of Lead Developer and the team has disbanded. Now, over at EmberForge Development I create mods with my friends from Kinetic Hosting. I honestly can't wait to see where the future takes us.
