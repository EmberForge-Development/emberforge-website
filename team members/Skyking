Hi, I'm SkyKing_PX. I'm 14 years old and I was always fascinated by tech and computers. I started programming with 10 with basic blocks. At the moment I am learning Java by programming Minecraft Plugins but am also planning to extend my knowledge with Mods.
In September 2024 I got partnered with KineticHosting which motivated me developing my first working Plugins while also making Modpacks. Now, being part of the EmberForge Development Team, I can learn about many new topics and develop Mods, Plugins and more with the help of other Team members and friends.
I'm exited about where the future takes us!
